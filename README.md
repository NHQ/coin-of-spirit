## list of deadline deadlines

+ create the github repo for the website, DONE
this is like the website's code before it is turned into website code. mainly text information and digital assets.  The REPO is here: https://github.com/NHQ/coin-of-spirit.
+ finish REPO, website design and publish website
the website's sections will mirror the outlined in the REPO.  in fact, that repo will be translated directly (it is written in a super EZ superset of HTML) so it is both a REPOSITORY for information about the project, and a place where we can collaboratively create a complex thing without repeating ourselves and copying files like dummies.  
+ video script and screenplay
3-7 pages scripted dialog and direction for video
+ design and create crypto cards
the primary visual for the project and concept, these will be much displayed and focused upon in the video and website
+ video shoot
where, when (probably OMNI, per the screenplay ;^)
+ video edit
+ video post effects
+ campaign start
